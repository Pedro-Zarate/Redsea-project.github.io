    <p>  This website was created as part of a personal project while learning software development, it was
       designed and created by myself.
        
       I thought this would be a cool way to remember the types of species 
         of animals and corals that we keep, so I built this webpage.
         
         Now friends and family can also learn about
          our small piece of the ocean, by simply scanning a QR code on the tank that directs them to this website.

           FAQ: You can learn more about the fish by double-clicking on the image of the one you're interested in on the fish page.
           This website is designed to open up a new tab on your phone to an article about that fish.
