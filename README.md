<h2> RedSea Reef Tank Project </h2>

<h3> Welcome! </h3>
<p> This is a one of my very first projects i build while learning HTML, CSS & Javascript. I build this website as a side project for my friends and family, when i have company over i get asked questions about my reef aquarium, 
  So i thought it would be easy for them to scan a qr code and have it direct them to this <a alt="Click Me" target="_blank" titile="Click Me" href="https://pedro-zarate.github.io/Redsea-project.github.io/">website</a> (go ahead try it yourself)</p>

<br/>

  <p> The website directs you to the main page where your able to click on the fish tab or coral tab these are all the animals inside the tank and it's environment  </p>

  <p> Once inside the Fish tab you can see all the fish and the name of the fish and once you double click on one it directs you to a Winkipedia page all about the anaimal.</p>
